# 🧠 ML-Optimization-Projects

This repository contains hands-on Python implementations of optimization techniques widely used in Machine Learning and Data Science. Developed by **Julieta Rubis**, this project showcases core algorithms like grid search, gradient descent, and both linear and nonlinear programming with detailed, well-documented code.

## 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on four key optimization strategies:

| Lesson | Topic | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Exhaustive Search | Grid search to tune model hyperparameters using scikit-learn |
| 2 | Gradient Descent | Manual implementation of gradient descent using NumPy |
| 3 | Linear Programming | Solve real-world LP problems with constraints using SciPy |
| 4 | Nonlinear Programming | Handle complex objectives and constraints with `minimize` |

## 🛠 Requirements

Make sure to install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

Each lesson is a standalone Python script. Simply run:

```bash
python lesson1_exhaustive_search.py
```

Repeat for lessons 2–4 by changing the file name.
