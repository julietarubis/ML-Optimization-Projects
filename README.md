# 🧠 ML-Optimization-Projects

This repository contains hands-on Jupyter notebook implementations of optimization techniques widely used in Machine Learning and Data Science. Developed by **Julieta Rubis**, this project showcases core algorithms like grid search, gradient descent, linear programming, and nonlinear programming — all fully documented and ready to explore.

## 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on four key optimization strategies:

| Lesson | Topic                | Description                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Exhaustive Search    | Grid search to tune model hyperparameters using scikit-learn                |
| 2      | Gradient Descent     | Manual implementation of gradient descent using NumPy                       |
| 3      | Linear Programming   | Solve real-world LP problems with constraints using SciPy                   |
| 4      | Nonlinear Programming| Handle complex objectives and constraints with `scipy.optimize.minimize`    |

## 🛠 Requirements

To run locally, install required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## 🚀 How to Run

### 🧪 Option 1: Run in Google Colab (No installation needed!)

1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Upload the notebook you want to explore (`.ipynb` files from this repo)
3. Run each cell interactively in the browser

### 💻 Option 2: Run Locally with Jupyter

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then open and run any of the following:

- `Exhaustive_Search.ipynb`
- `Gradient_Descent.ipynb`
- `Linear_Programming.ipynb`
- `Nonlinear_Programming.ipynb`
